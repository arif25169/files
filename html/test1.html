<h1>How to properly handle an HTML&nbsp;form</h1><p><br></p><p>One of the simplest things somebody would like to do in a web application is to display a form to the user and then handle the data the application received from the form. This is a very common task however there are many loose ends and things that a new developer can do wrong. Recently, I tried to explain this to somebody however I couldn’t find a tutorial containing all the information I think it is important. So I decided to write it&nbsp;here.</p><p>To make it very easy to test it and understand it I decided to use&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;to handle the form submission. I must confess that I don’t like&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;and I never use it in production apps (unless I need to support an existing one). However, for such simple tasks and examples&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;is probably the easiest thing for a new developer to understand: Just create a&nbsp;.php&nbsp;file and put it in a folder in your apache&nbsp;htdocs; there now you can test the&nbsp;behavior!</p><p>This tutorial will be as comprehensive as possible and will try to explain all things that I feel that need explaining. However I won’t go into details about&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;or&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;syntax; you’ll need to know some things about them to understand what’s going on here; after all the important thing is to understand the big picture so you can re-implement them in your case (or understand why your web framework does what it&nbsp;does).</p>
